# Scrolly

*A dumb-as-heck _(non-pejorative)_ middle click scroll extension for Chrome/Chromium based browsers*

## Why

I flip back-and-forth between Mac and Windows regularly, and one thing Microsoft holds dominion on, _for whatever reason,_ is middle-click scrolling.

Looking at Chrome extensions, I didn't see any that I trusted and anything I installed threw a warning that the extension "could read all of my website data" -- which may or may not be true and may or may not be a useful warning, but nonetheless I figured it was better to be safe than sorry.

15 minutes later, I have a vibe-coded extension that I can self-serve. Hells yes.

## What

Truly the most-minimal possible extension.
- Middle click and drag and it scrolls.
- Middle-click briefly and it scrolls.
- Middle-click briefly again and it stops scrolls.

The end.

## Installation

Claude says you should do this to make it work:

1. Clone this repo.
1. Load up your extensions page:
     - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
     - Vivaldi: `vivaldi://extensions/`
     - Edge: `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top-right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select your `scrolly` folder
1. ...
1. Scroll
